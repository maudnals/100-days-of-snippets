    -----
    we do: 
    rootElement = patch(container, rootElement, oldNode, oldNode = next)
    It's shorter, more elegant, and makes sense (dev mental model) 
    because this variable reassignment
    is done *for* (*through*) this function call. So doing it in the 
    function call itself makes it clearer!

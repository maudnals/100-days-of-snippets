/**
 * ----
 * What is it?
 * ----
 * It's called a declaration ("d") file.
 * ----
 * What is it for?
 * ----
 * For third-party TypeScript developers.
 * It provides TypeScript with type informations about a JS API.
 * It gives us the benefits of static typing while still having√ß simply JS code.
 * ----
 * How is it created?
 * ----
 * - Written by hand
 * - Generated from a TypeScript file automatically (only signatures of the types which are exported)
 * ----
 * How to map a *.d.ts file to a js file?
 * ----
 * Before: one had to reference the file explicitly using: //<reference path="path/to/file.d.ts" />
 * Now: automatic with the TypeScriptCompile option?

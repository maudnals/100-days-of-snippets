/**
 * OK. so short intro to reactive programming.
 * ----
 * What's the 101 of reactive programming?
 * It's based on the Observer Design Pattern.
 * STREAM = sequence of ongoing events orderered in time. The stream is the subject being observed (= the observable).
 * We SUBSCRIBE (=listen) to the stream.
 * We define a function that will execute when a value is executed: this is the OBSERVER. 
 * That way, we capture these emitted events only asynchronously.
 * More precisely, in RxJS:
 * Because the stream can emit 3 different things - a value, an error,
 * or a "completed" signal - we define up to 3 observer types: a 
 * function that will execute when a value is emitted, another 
 * function when an error is emitted, and another function when  
 * 'completed' is emitted. The second 2 can be omitted.
 * ----
 * What would be required to make redux compatible with it?
 * - A stream: that's the stream of events that apply a change to the state ; the state story becomes the stream
 * - A subscribe method...
 * - To subscribe an observer
